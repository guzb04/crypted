Hello! this project was made by Guzm√°n Beyhaut

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:

1 download node.js

2 open a terminal on the client folder and run the following:
  -  npm install
  -  npm run dev
    
This should install your client dependencies and start the development server, which you can access through your browser by clicking the URL that the terminal returns to you.

3 open another terminal on the server folder and repeat the steps. this opens a server on localhost:3000 YOU DONT HAVE TO OPEN THIS ON YOUR BROWSER, THIS IS THE BACKEND.

4 upload your zip file to your browser (see step 2) in the box on the left and generate a key, then click the "send the data" button, remember to save your key!

5 when you're ready to decrypt the file, enter the key in the box on the right and upload your json file (should be called crypted.json, but this doesnt interfere with the backend), then wait for your download.

Woohoo! now you have an encrypted json file to send and have verified that the decryption system works.
I encourage going through the code and running your own instance to ensure your data is completely private and is not being sent to me or leaked.
